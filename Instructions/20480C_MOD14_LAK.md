# Module 14: Performing Background Processing by Using Web Workers.

# Lab: Creating a Web Worker Process.

### Lab Setup

### Preparation Steps

1.	Ensure that you have cloned the 20480C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20480-Programming-in-HTML5-with-JavaScript-and-CSS3/tree/master/Allfiles.

### Exercise 1: Improving Responsiveness by Using a Web Worker.

#### Task 1: Review the Speaker Badge page.

1.	Open **Visual Studio 2017**.
2.	In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3.	In the **Open Project** dialog box, browse to **Allfiles\Mod14\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 1**, click **ContosoConf.sln**, and then click **Open**.
4.	In Solution Explorer, expand the **ContosoConf** project, and then double-click **speaker-badge.htm**.
5.	Verify that the page contains the following HTML markup:
    ```javascript
        <script src="/scripts/grayscale.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    ```
6.	In Solution Explorer, expand the **scripts** folder, and then double-click **grayscale.js**.
7.	Verify that the file contains the following JavaScript function:
    ```javascript
        export function grayscaleImage(image) {
			// Converts a colour image into gray scale.

			// Return a new promise.
			return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
				
				const canvas = createCanvas(image);
				const context = canvas.getContext("2d");
				const imageData = getImageData(context, image);

				// TODO: Create a Worker that runs /scripts/grayscale-worker.js

				const pixels = imageData.data;
				// 4 array items per pixel => Red, Green, Blue, Alpha
				for (const i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
					grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
				}

				// Update the canvas with the gray scaled image data.
				context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
				context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);

				// Returning a Promise makes this function easy to chain together with other deferred operations.
				// The canvas object is returned as this can be used like an image.
				resolve([canvas]);
			});
		};
    ```

#### Task 2: Convert the speaker badge image to grayscale.

1.	In Solution Explorer, in the **scripts** folder, and then double-click **speakerBadgePage.js**.
2.	In **speaker-badge.js**, find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Add grayscaleImage into the processing pipeline.
    ```
3.	Modify the code following this comment, as shown below in bold:
    ```javascript
		this.readFile(file)
			.then((file) => this.loadImage(file))
			.then((file) => grayscaleImage(file))
			.then((file) => this.notBusy(file));
    ```
4.	In Solution Explorer, double-click **speaker-badge.htm**.
5.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
6.	In Microsoft Edge, if the message **Intranet settings are turned off by default** appears, click **Don’t show this message again**.
7.	On the Windows taskbar, click **File Explorer**.
8.	Browse to the folder **Allfiles\Mod14\Labfiles\Resources**.
9.	Drag **mark-hanson-large.jpg** from Windows Explorer into Microsoft Edge and drop it onto the canvas with the label **Drag your profile photo here**.
10.	Verify that you cannot scroll the page or move to another page until after the image has been displayed. This may take several seconds.
11.	If Microsoft Edge displays the message **localhost is not responding due to a long-running script**, wait for the message to disappear.
12.	Close Microsoft Edge.

#### Task 3: Create a web worker to perform image processing.

1.	In Visual Studio, in Solution Explorer, in the **scripts** folder, double-click **grayscale.js**
2.	Find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Create a Worker that runs /scripts/grayscale-worker.js
    ```
3.	After this comment, add the following JavsScript code:
    ```javascript
        var worker = new Worker("/scripts/grayscale-worker.js");
        worker.postMessage(imageData);
    ```
4.	In Solution Explorer, in the **scripts** folder, double-click **grayscale-worker.js**.
5.	Add the following JavaScript code to this file, after the comment at the top:
    ```javascript
        addEventListener("message", function (event) {
        
        });
    ```
6.	In Solution Explorer, double-click **grayscale.js**. 
7.	Find the following JavaScript statements:
    ```javascript
        const worker = new Worker("/scripts/grayscale-worker.js");
        worker.postMessage(imageData);
    ```
8.	Insert the following code shown in bold between these two statements:
    ```javascript
        const worker = new Worker("/scripts/grayscale-worker.js");
        const handleMessage = function (event) {
        };
        worker.addEventListener("message", handleMessage.bind(this));
        worker.postMessage(imageData);
    ```

#### Task 4: Move image processing code into the web worker.

1.	In **grayscale.js**, cut the following code that defines the **grayscalePixel** function to the clipboard:
    ```javascript
		function grayscalePixel(pixels, index) {
			/// <summary>Updates the pixel, starting at the given index, to be gray scale.</summary>

			const brightness = 0.34 * pixels[index] + 0.5 * pixels[index + 1] + 0.16 * pixels[index + 2];

			pixels[index] = brightness; // red
			pixels[index + 1] = brightness; // green
			pixels[index + 2] = brightness; // blue
		};
    ```
2.	In **grayscale-worker.js**, underneath the existing code, paste the JavaScript code for the **grayscalePixel** function from the clipboard.
3.	In **grayscale.js**, in the **grayscaleImage()** function, delete the following code:
    ```javascript
        const pixels = imageData.data;
        // 4 array items per pixel => Red, Green, Blue, Alpha
        for (let i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
            grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
        }
    ```
4.	In **grayscale-worker.js**, add the following code shown in bold to the 
    ```javascript
        addEventListener("message", function (event) {
        
            const imageData = event.data;
            const pixels = imageData.data;
            for (let i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
                grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
            }
        });
    ```

#### Task 5: Return image data from the web worker.

1.	In **grayscale-worker.js**, after the **for** loop in the **addEventListener** statement, add the following code shown in bold:
    ```javascript
        for (let i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
            grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
        }
        postMessage({ done: imageData });
    ```
2.	In **grayscale.js**, in the **grayscaleImage()** function, delete the following code: 
    ```javascript
        // Update the canvas with the gray scaled image data.
        context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
        context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);

        // Returning a jQuery Deferred makes this function easy to chain together with other deferred operations.
        // The canvas object is returned as this can be used like an image.
        deferred.resolveWith(this, [canvas]);
    ```
3.	Find the following JavaScript statement:
    ```javascript
          const handleMessage = function (event) { };
    ```
4.	Add following JavaScript code shown in bold to this statement:
    ```javascript
        const handleMessage = function (event) {
            // Update the canvas with the gray scaled image data.
            context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
            context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);

            // Returning a Promise makes this function easy to chain together with other deferred operations.
            // The canvas object is returned as this can be used like an image.
            resolve([canvas]);
        };
    ```

#### Task 6: Test the application.

1.	On the Windows taskbar, click the Microsoft Edge icon.
2.	In Microsoft Edge, press F12.
3.	On the **Cache** menu, click **Clear browser cache**.
4.	In the **Clear Browser Cache** message box, click **Yes**.
5.	Press F12, and then close Microsoft Edge.
6.	In Visual Studio, in Solution Explorer, double-click **speaker-badge.htm**.
7.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
8.	On the taskbar, click **File Explorer**.
9.	Browse to the **Allfiles\Mod14\Labfiles\Resources** folder.
10.	Drag **mark-hanson-large.jpg** from File Explorer into Microsoft Edge and drop it onto the canvas with the label **Drag your profile photo here**.
11.	Verify that you can scroll the page up and down while and image is being processed.
12.	Close Microsoft Edge.

>**Results:** After completing this exercise, you will have a created a web page that remains responsive while slow image processing code runs in a web worker.
