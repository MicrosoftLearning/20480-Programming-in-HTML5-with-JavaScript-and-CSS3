# Module 14: Performing Background Processing by Using Web Workers

# Lab: Creating a Web Worker Process

### Lab Setup

### Preparation Steps

Ensure that you have cloned the 20480C directory from GitHub (**https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20480-Programming-in-HTML5-with-JavaScript-and-CSS3/tree/master/Allfiles**). It contains the code segments for the labs and demos in this course.

### Exercise 1: Improving Responsiveness by Using a Web Worker

#### Task 1: Review the Speaker Badge page

1.	Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
2.	In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3.	In the **Open Project** dialog box, browse to **Allfiles\Mod14\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 1**, click **ContosoConf.sln**, and then click **Open**.
4.	In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **ContosoConf** project, and then double-click **speaker-badge.htm**.
5.	Verify that the page contains the following HTML markup:
    ```javascript
        <script src="/scripts/grayscale.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    ```
6.	In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **scripts** folder, and then double-click **grayscale.js**.
7.	Verify that the file contains the following JavaScript function:
    ```javascript
        export function grayscaleImage(image) {
			// Converts a colour image into gray scale.

			// Return a new promise.
			return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
				
				const canvas = createCanvas(image);
				const context = canvas.getContext("2d");
				const imageData = getImageData(context, image);

				// TODO: Create a Worker that runs /scripts/grayscale-worker.js

				const pixels = imageData.data;
				// 4 array items per pixel => Red, Green, Blue, Alpha
				for (const i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
					grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
				}

				// Update the canvas with the gray scaled image data.
				context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
				context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);

				// Returning a Promise makes this function easy to chain together with other deferred operations.
				// The canvas object is returned as this can be used as an image.
				resolve([canvas]);
			});
		};
    ```

#### Task 2: Convert the speaker badge image to grayscale

1.	In **Solution Explorer**, in the **scripts** folder, double-click **speakerBadgePage.js**.
2.	In **speaker-badge.js**, find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Add grayscaleImage into the processing pipeline.
    ```
3.	Modify the code following this comment, as shown below:
    ```javascript
		this.readFile(file)
			.then((file) => this.loadImage(file))
			.then((file) => grayscaleImage(file))
			.then((file) => this.notBusy(file));
    ```
4.	In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **speaker-badge.htm**.
5.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
6.	In Microsoft Edge, if the **Intranet settings are turned off by default** message appears, click **Don’t show this message again**.
7.	On the Windows Taskbar, click **File Explorer**.
8.	Browse to the **Allfiles\Mod14\Labfiles\Resources** folder.
9.	Drag **mark-hanson-large.jpg** from Windows Explorer into Microsoft Edge and drop it onto the canvas with the label **Drag your profile photo here**.
10.	Verify that you cannot scroll the page or move to another page until the image has been displayed. This may take several seconds.
11.	If Microsoft Edge displays the **localhost is not responding due to a long-running script** message, wait for the message to disappear.
12.	Close Microsoft Edge.

#### Task 3: Create a web worker to perform image processing

1.	In Visual Studio, in **Solution Explorer**, in the **scripts** folder, double-click **grayscale.js**
2.	Find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Create a Worker that runs /scripts/grayscale-worker.js
    ```
3.	After this comment, add the following JavsScript code:
    ```javascript
        const worker = new Worker("/scripts/grayscale-worker.js");
        worker.postMessage(imageData);
    ```
4.	In **Solution Explorer**, in the **scripts** folder, double-click **grayscale-worker.js**.
5.	Add the following JavaScript code to this file, after the comment at the top:
    ```javascript
        addEventListener("message", function (event) {
        
        });
    ```
6.	In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **grayscale.js**. 
7.	Find the following JavaScript statements:
    ```javascript
        const worker = new Worker("/scripts/grayscale-worker.js");
        worker.postMessage(imageData);
    ```
8.	Insert the following code between these two statements:
    ```javascript
        const worker = new Worker("/scripts/grayscale-worker.js");
        const handleMessage = function (event) {
        };
        worker.addEventListener("message", handleMessage.bind(this));
        worker.postMessage(imageData);
    ```

#### Task 4: Move image processing code into the web worker

1.	In **grayscale.js**, cut the following code that defines the **grayscalePixel** function to the clipboard:
    ```javascript
		function grayscalePixel(pixels, index) {
			/// <summary>Updates the pixel, starting at the given index, to be gray scale.</summary>

			const brightness = 0.34 * pixels[index] + 0.5 * pixels[index + 1] + 0.16 * pixels[index + 2];

			pixels[index] = brightness; // red
			pixels[index + 1] = brightness; // green
			pixels[index + 2] = brightness; // blue
		};
    ```
2.	In **grayscale-worker.js**, underneath the existing code, paste the JavaScript code for the **grayscalePixel** function from the clipboard.
3.	In **grayscale.js**, in the **grayscaleImage()** function, delete the following code:
    ```javascript
        const pixels = imageData.data;
        // 4 array items per pixel => Red, Green, Blue, Alpha
        for (let i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
            grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
        }
    ```
4.	In **grayscale-worker.js**, add the following code:
    ```javascript
        addEventListener("message", function (event) {
        
            const imageData = event.data;
            const pixels = imageData.data;
            for (let i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
                grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
            }
        });
    ```

#### Task 5: Return image data from the web worker

1.	In **grayscale-worker.js**, after the **for** loop in the **addEventListener** statement, add the following code:
    ```javascript
        for (let i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
            grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
        }
        postMessage({ done: imageData });
    ```
2.	In **grayscale.js**, in the **grayscaleImage()** function, delete the following code: 
    ```javascript
        // Update the canvas with the gray scaled image data.
        context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
        context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);

        // Returning a jQuery Deferred makes this function easy to chain together with other deferred operations.
        // The canvas object is returned as this can be used like an image.
        deferred.resolveWith(this, [canvas]);
    ```
3.	Find the following JavaScript statement:
    ```javascript
          const handleMessage = function (event) { };
    ```
4.	Add the following JavaScript code to this statement:
    ```javascript
        const handleMessage = function (event) {
            // Update the canvas with the gray scaled image data.
            context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
            context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);

            // Returning a Promise makes this function easy to chain together with other deferred operations.
            // The canvas object is returned as this can be used like an image.
            resolve([canvas]);
        };
    ```

#### Task 6: Test the application

1.	On the Windows Taskbar, click **Microsoft Edge**.
2.	In Microsoft Edge, press F12.
3.	On the **Cache** menu, click **Clear browser cache**.
4.	In the **Clear Browser Cache** message box, click **Yes**.
5.	Press F12, and then close Microsoft Edge.
6.	In Visual Studio, in **Solution Explorer**, double-click **speaker-badge.htm**.
7.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
8.	On the Windows Taskbar, click **File Explorer**.
9.	Browse to the **Allfiles\Mod14\Labfiles\Resources** folder.
10.	Drag **mark-hanson-large.jpg** from File Explorer into Microsoft Edge and drop it onto the canvas with the label **Drag your profile photo here**.
11.	Verify that you can scroll the page up and down while the image is being processed.
12.	Close Microsoft Edge.

>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have created a web page that remains responsive while slow image processing code runs on the web worker.
